conversion of clear text to cipher text is called encryption

breach - loss of control
event - observable occurence in a network
bug - deviation from a actual recquirement
incident - which affect the cia is called incident
intuusion - security event called intrusion
threat - 
risk - threat + vulnerability
TOE - target of evaluation or targeting the ip address

IPV4
192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 ->256 ips are there
192.168.1.1/24 - 32bit-decimal (0-9)
11000000.10101000.0000001.00000001

IPv6
128bit-hexadecimal-(0-9 & A-F)

MYSQL use - 
local host work on port 80.
TO hang onother pc by this following steps
        1.Open notepad
        2.write @echo off
        3.andstart writing start clasi etc.... and saves the file in files and open then the system will hang
windows works on 
 1.exe.file
 2.batt file
in windows while using the ping(ip address who you attack )it will transfer 4 packets as default
but in linux we need to determine the count ping(ip address who you attack)-c-4
 HOW TO FIND IP ADDRESS OF SOMEONE
  1.Go to cmd and write ping and paste the webside name and remove the last \ and www. or https like that 
       eg:C:\Users\manim>ping lms.careertiq.com

Network 
  1.use the cross over wire to connect
  2.straight though is used for connecting different devices
  3.to connect 2 routers we choose the  serial cable
ip is a temperary address
mac address is a permanent address

    WEB APPLICATION
    client Request -------->Server Response----->DB
     HTTP Methods
     Get
     post
     put
     options
     delete
     RESPONSE CODE can start with
1xx -Informational
2xx -Ok
3xx -Redirection
4xx -Client error
5xx -Server side error
      TYPES OF ENVIRONMENT
 1.Production environment- it has a highly maintance and risk testing eg:live website/web app
 2.stage environment - Actual copy of production environment
 3.QA environment - test building(it is easy to testing)

 CLIENT--------->Burp Proxy-------->server
 CLIENT--------->Proxy1-------->Proxy2-------->Proxy3-------->Proxy4-------->Proxy5-------->Proxy6-------->server
  Burpsuitr is works like a proxy


             ATTACKS
All combination password called bruteforce attack
list of passwoed compared together and then hack is called bruteforce attack
